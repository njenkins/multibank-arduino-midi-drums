# Arduino Multi Bank MIDI Drums
This repo holds code and schematics for 4 pad, multi bank Arduino MIDI drumkit.

This sketch probably does not work yet. Is was written on a train. Consider it pseudocode.


## What you'll need
* 1 x Arduino Nano (Brain)
* 4 x Piezo Discs (Drum Pads)
* 4 x 1 megaohm Resistors (For each drum pads)
* 1 x Rotary Switch (For Bank Switch. Minimum 5 position)
* 1 x 100k Potentiometer (B Type) (For sensitivity control)
* 1 x 5 Pin Male MIDI Jack (For MIDI Output)
* 1 x 5v Power Supply (To power unit)
* 1 x Power Jack (For power connection)
* 1 x 220 ohm Resistor (For MIDI port)
* 1 x Toggle Switch (Power switch)
* 1 X LED (Power indicator)
* 1 x ? ohm resistor (LED resistor)
* 1 X ? Diode (Reverse polarity protection)
